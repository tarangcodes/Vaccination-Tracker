# Kiddo Vaccinations

A simple, client-side web application to help parents track childhood vaccinations for children from birth to 11 years. This project is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using browser localStorage for data persistence.

## ✨ Features

- **User Accounts**: Simple registration and login system.
- **Child Profiles**: Add and manage multiple child profiles.
- **Vaccine Tracking**: View a detailed list of recommended vaccines, mark them as "Done" or "Pending", and track progress.
- **Dashboard**: A central hub to view all children and their overall vaccination progress.
- **Printable Certificate**: Generate and print a simple vaccination certificate for any child.
- **Parent Directory**: Keep a record of parent/guardian details.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Storage**: Browser `localStorage` is used to store all user, child, and vaccine data. No server or database is required.
- **Local Development**: Can be run with any simple local HTTP server (e.g., Python's `http.server`).

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the source code).
2.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/PBL-project
    ```
3.  **Start a simple local web server**. If you have Python installed, you can run:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
4.  **Open your browser** and go to the following address:
    [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

The application should load automatically.
